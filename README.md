# ⚛️ React Journey

This repository documents my focused React refresh — building hands-on projects to deepen my frontend expertise as I transition into advanced full-stack and DevOps roles.

Each project is designed to sharpen modern React skills using functional components, hooks, clean architecture, and real-world scenarios.
